# fingerprinting

This project is designed to be used for fingerprinting javascript files and return a unique hash for each seperate file. If a file is similar such as a Google Analytics script then it should return the same hash.

## Why?

We need a way to identify unique javascript files and be able to track them over time. This is useful for tracking changes in the javascript files and also for tracking the usage of the javascript files.

## Status

This project is currently in development and is not ready for production use.
