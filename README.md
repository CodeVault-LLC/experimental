# Experimental Labs

Experimental projects for future use and/or testing. This repository contains experimental projects, code snippets, mini-projects, and other stuff that are not intended to be used in production. The projects are intended to be used for testing, learning, and experimenting with new technologies, libraries, and frameworks.

## Dumps

We have a `dumps` directory along with some other sub-names you can find in `.gitignore` file. The `dumps` directory contains dumps of databases, files, and other stuff that are used in the projects. The dumps are intended to be used for testing and learning purposes only. The dumps are not intended to be used in production.

## FAQ

- **Q:** I copied the code, but it doesn't work. What should I do?
- **A:** Copying code parts from the repository may not work as expected, or giving side effects which are not intended. We cannot guarantee that the code will work as expected in your environment. Refrain from contacting us for these issues, rather make the issues on the repository or make pull requests to fix the issues.

- **Q:** Can I use the code in my project?
- **A:** Yes, you can use the code in your project. However, you must follow the license terms. The license terms are available in the `LICENSE` file.

- **Q:** I am missing some dependencies, where do I find them?\*\*
- **A:** Well the simple answer is, look for the dependencies in potential areas where they could be found, for example in code-parts, in a `requirements.txt` file, or in the `README.md` file. If you still can't find the dependencies, something may be wrong with the enviroment or the code itself.

- **Q:** Why is some projects never updated?
- **A:** Some projects are never updated because they are either deprecated, or they are not intended to be updated. Some projects may be dragged into custom repositories, or they may simply just be removed in the future.
